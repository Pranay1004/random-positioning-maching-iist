DISCLAIMER - AI-Generated Code & Licensing
==========================================

AI-GENERATED CONTENT NOTICE
----------------------------

This software was developed with significant assistance from AI tools:
  - GitHub Copilot (code completion and suggestions)
  - Claude/Anthropic (architecture design, documentation, implementation)
  - Human Direction (requirements, physics specifications, testing)

Estimated Contribution:
  AI-Generated: ~80% (code structure, implementation, documentation)
  Human-Directed: ~20% (requirements, physics equations, testing)


WHO OWNS AI-GENERATED CODE?
----------------------------

Legal Status (as of January 2026):
  - AI-generated works may not be copyrightable alone (US Copyright Office)
  - Works with human creative input may be copyrightable
  - This project includes human direction, requirements, and modifications
  
Practical Conclusion:
  The project is owned and maintained by Department of Aerospace Engineering, IIST
  AI tools used as development assistants (like using an IDE)
  Human creativity in design, requirements, and testing


RECOMMENDED LICENSE: MIT
-------------------------

Why MIT License:
  ✓ Simple and permissive
  ✓ Allows commercial use
  ✓ Minimal restrictions
  ✓ Compatible with AI-generated code
  ✓ Well-understood legally
  ✓ Used by dependencies (Three.js, FastAPI, NumPy)

MIT License Terms:
  - Anyone can use, modify, distribute (commercial or not)
  - Must include copyright notice and license text
  - NO WARRANTY - author not liable
  - Protects from lawsuits


COMMERCIAL USE: ACCEPTABLE
--------------------------

AI-generated code CAN be used commercially:

✓ All libraries used are permissively licensed (MIT, BSD)
✓ No patented algorithms used
✓ Only published research equations (not patented)
✓ GitHub Copilot/Claude output belongs to user
✓ Significant human direction and design

You CAN:
  - Sell this software
  - Offer as SaaS
  - Integrate into commercial products
  - License to others commercially

You MUST:
  - Cite research paper (Yotov et al.)
  - Disclose AI assistance (transparency)
  - Keep license notices from dependencies


LIABILITY DISCLAIMER: NO WARRANTY
----------------------------------

This software is provided "AS-IS" without warranties:
  ❌ No guarantee of accuracy
  ❌ No guarantee of fitness for purpose
  ❌ No liability for damages
  
Specific Disclaimers:
  1. Physics based on research, but implementation may have errors
  2. Not validated against physical machines
  3. Research/education only - NOT medical use
  4. AI code may contain bugs
  5. Not FDA approved
  
Author NOT liable for:
  - Any damages (direct, indirect, consequential)
  - Loss of profits, data, or use
  - Business interruption
  - Third party claims


HOW TO RELEASE PUBLICLY
------------------------

Step 1: Add LICENSE File (MIT License recommended)
Step 2: Add AI disclosure to README.md
Step 3: Cite research paper in documentation
Step 4: Add this DISCLAIMER file
Step 5: Make GitHub repo public

Include in README:
  "This project was developed with AI assistance (GitHub Copilot, Claude).
   See DISCLAIMER.md for licensing details."


REFERENCES USED
---------------

Only ONE research paper was used:
  - Yotov et al., "A New Random Positioning Machine Modification..."
  - Used for: Rotation matrices, taSMG concept, physics equations

NO other sources:
  ✗ No other research papers searched
  ✗ No patents used
  ✗ No code copied from other implementations
  
All libraries are open source (MIT/BSD licenses).

See docs/REFERENCES.txt for complete list.


LEGAL OBSERVATIONS
------------------

Risk Assessment:
  - Patent Risk: LOW (no patented algorithms)
  - Copyright Risk: LOW (one cited paper, open source libs)
  - Trademark Risk: NONE (generic term "RPM")
  - Liability Risk: MITIGATED (MIT license disclaimer)

Safe Release Requirements:
  ✓ Use MIT License with disclaimer
  ✓ Disclose AI assistance
  ✓ Cite research sources
  ✓ Don't make medical claims
  ✓ Mark as "research/educational use"


WHEN TO CONSULT A LAWYER
-------------------------

Consider legal advice if:
  - Planning >$100k revenue from this
  - Competitor claims patent infringement
  - Licensing to large companies
  - Expanding to medical/regulated use
  - Facing legal threats

For small open source release:
  MIT License + Disclaimers = Sufficient Protection
