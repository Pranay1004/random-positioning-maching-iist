# DISCLAIMER - AI-Generated Code & Licensing

## AI-Generated Content Notice

**This software was developed with significant assistance from AI tools:**

- **GitHub Copilot** - Code completion and suggestions
- **Claude (Anthropic)** - Architecture design, documentation, and implementation guidance
- **Human Direction** - Project requirements, physics specifications, and design decisions

**Estimated Contribution:**
- AI-Generated: ~80% (code structure, implementation, documentation)
- Human-Directed: ~20% (requirements, physics equations from research paper, testing)

## Intellectual Property and Ownership

### Who Owns AI-Generated Code?

As of January 2026, the legal status of AI-generated code varies by jurisdiction:

**United States:**
- AI-generated works may not be copyrightable on their own (US Copyright Office guidance)
- However, works with human creative input may be copyrightable
- This project includes human direction, requirements specification, and modifications
- **Practical status:** Code is likely ownable by the human who directed the AI

**European Union:**
- Similar principles apply
- Human authorship required for copyright
- AI as a tool (like a compiler) may still result in human-owned work

**General Consensus:**
- Code generated by AI *at human direction* is typically owned by the human
- Modifications and selection by humans strengthen ownership claims
- Open source release doesn't require copyright, but clarifies usage rights

**Conclusion for this project:**
- The project is owned and maintained by Department of Aerospace Engineering, IIST
- AI tools used as development assistants (like using an IDE or compiler)
- Human creativity in design, requirements, and testing

## Licensing Options for This Project

### Recommended: MIT License

**Why MIT License is Best for This Project:**
- ✅ Simple and permissive
- ✅ Allows commercial use
- ✅ Minimal restrictions on users
- ✅ Compatible with AI-generated code

- ✅ Used by most open source AI tools (Three.js, FastAPI, etc.)

**MIT License Terms:**
- Anyone can use, modify, distribute commercially or non-commercially
- Must include copyright notice and license text
- NO WARRANTY - author not liable for issues
- Protects you from lawsuits

### Alternative: Apache 2.0 License

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Explicit patent grant protection
- ✅ More formal contributor agreements
- ✅ Better for corporate adoption

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex legal text
- Overkill for small projects

### Alternative: GPL v3 (Copyleft)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Forces derivatives to remain open source
- ✅ Prevents proprietary forks

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ May limit commercial adoption
- ❌ More restrictive (not recommended for AI-generated code)

### NOT Recommended: Custom or Proprietary License

**Why avoid:**
- Unclear legal status with AI-generated code
- Limits adoption and contribution
- May create legal uncertainties

---

## Commercial Use Acceptability

### Can AI-Generated Code Be Used Commercially?

**YES** - with important considerations:

1. **License Compatibility**
   - All libraries used (NumPy, Three.js, FastAPI) are permissively licensed
   - MIT and BSD licenses allow commercial use
   - No GPL components that would force open sourcing

2. **No Patent Conflicts**
   - No patented algorithms used
   - Only standard physics equations and numerical methods
   - Research paper equations are published (not patented)

3. **AI Tool Terms of Service**
   - GitHub Copilot: Output belongs to user (can use commercially)
   - Claude: Similar terms - output usable commercially
   - Check current ToS for confirmation

4. **Original Contribution**
   - Significant human direction and design choices
   - Novel implementation approach
   - Custom UI/UX design

**Commercial Paths:**

✅ **Acceptable:**
- Sell this software as-is or modified
- Offer as a service (SaaS)
- Integrate into commercial products
- Provide consulting using this code
- License to others commercially

❌ **Not Acceptable Without Changes:**
- Claiming invention of the physics (cite research paper)
- Claiming no AI assistance (must disclose)
- Removing license notices from dependencies

## Best Practices for Public Release

### Do This:

1. ✅ **Be Transparent**
   - Clearly state AI assistance
   - Cite all sources (research paper, libraries)
   - Include proper license

2. ✅ **Add Disclaimers**
   - Not for medical use
   - No warranty
   - Research/educational only

3. ✅ **Document Everything**
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples
   - Limitations and known issues

4. ✅ **Test Before Release**
   - Run all tests
   - Verify physics accuracy
   - Check dependencies

5. ✅ **Add Contributing Guidelines**
   - How others can contribute
   - Code standards
   - Pull request process

### Don't Do This:

1. ❌ **Hide AI Usage**
   - Don't claim you wrote all code manually
   - Transparency builds trust

2. ❌ **Overpromise**
   - Don't claim medical accuracy
   - Don't guarantee zero bugs

3. ❌ **Forget Attribution**
   - Always cite research paper
   - Always include library licenses

4. ❌ **Use Restrictive License**
   - Avoid GPL unless you want copyleft
   - MIT is safest for AI-generated code

## Legal Observations

### Current Legal Landscape (2026)

1. **AI Code Ownership**
   - Still evolving area of law
   - Generally: Human who directs AI owns the output
   - Some jurisdictions uncertain

2. **Patent Risk**
   - Low for this project (no patented algorithms)
   - Standard physics and math not patentable
   - Implementation details likely not novel enough to infringe

3. **Copyright Risk**
   - Low risk (only one research paper used)
   - Research paper equations are published (fair use)
   - No code copied from other implementations

4. **Trademark Risk**
   - None (generic term "RPM")
   - Not using any commercial RPM brand names

5. **Liability Risk**
   - Mitigated by MIT license disclaimer
   - Further mitigated by "research use only" notice
   - No medical claims made

### Recommendations

1. **Use MIT License** - Clearest for AI code
2. **Add AI Disclosure** - Transparency helps legally
3. **Include Research Citation** - Academic courtesy and legal safety
4. **Add NO WARRANTY Notice** - Standard liability protection
5. **Consider Trademark** - If you want to brand this uniquely
6. **Get Insurance** - If commercializing heavily (E&O insurance)

### When to Consult a Lawyer

Consider legal advice if:
- Planning significant commercial use (>$100k revenue)
- Approached by competitors about patents
- Considering selling/licensing to large companies
- Expanding to medical/regulated applications
- Facing any legal threats

For small open source release: **MIT License + Disclaimers = Good Enough**
